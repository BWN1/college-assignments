## About the project

For this project, we created a UI for the fictional lottery game `WHE WHE on Dâ€™ Avenue` using `Angular`. Users can selected numbers to create a lottery ticket and place a bet for their ticket. After the numbers have been selected and the bet has been placed, users are directed to a page that has their created ticket on it.

There is no backend functionality as this project is solely frontend.

## Running the application

- First, install the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) using `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Use `npm start` or `ng serve` inside the project folder to start the server
