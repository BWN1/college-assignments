### Setup

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies in both the `client` and `server` directory

To run this application locally, copy the `.env.template` file and assign the following environment variables with your own

`PORT`: The port to run your server

`DATABASE_URI`: The URI to your MongoDB database

To start the backend server, run `npm start` in the root folder. You then need to start the React server which can be done by entering `cd client` followed by `npm start`
