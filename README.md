# JAC444

This is the repo for my Java course at Seneca College

# [Week 1](./week1)

In this week we were just getting introduced to Java. The assignment for this week was to create a Pascal's triangle

# [Week 2](./week2)

This week we created our own `Stack` class. This class is used in the `Palindrome` class which takes a command line arg and determines if the string passed is a palindrome or not

# [Week 3](./week3)

This week we created a `Shape` interface. We created the classes `Paralellogram`, `Triangle` and `Circle` which implement the `Shape` interface. We also created the class `Rectangle` which is derived from `Parallelogram` as well as `Square` which is derived from `Rectangle`.
