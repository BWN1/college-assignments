# JAC444

This is the repo for my Java course at Seneca College

# [Workshop 1](./week1)

In this workshop we were just getting introduced to Java. The assignment for this week was to create a Pascal's triangle

# [Workshop 2](./week2)

This workshop we created our own `Stack` class. This class is used in the `Palindrome` class which takes a command line arg and determines if the string passed is a palindrome or not

# [Workshop 3](./week3)

This workshop we created a `Shape` interface. We created the classes `Paralellogram`, `Triangle` and `Circle` which implement the `Shape` interface. We also created the class `Rectangle` which is derived from `Parallelogram` as well as `Square` which is derived from `Rectangle`.

# [Workshop 4](./week4)

This workshop we created added additional tasks to the program developed in workshop 3. One task was to filter out `Triangle`'s with the smallest perimeter and `Circle`'s with the largest perimeter. The other task was to add the perimeter of all the `Parallelogram`'s and `Triangle`'s that had been filtered in the previous task.

# [Workshop 5](./week5)

This workshop we used console IO to create `Student` objects and add it to an ArrayList. These objects were then serialized and written to a file called `students`. The objects were then deserialized and printed out.
