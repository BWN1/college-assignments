# JAC444

This is the repo for my Java course at Seneca College

# [Workshop 1](./workshop1)

In this workshop we were just getting introduced to Java. The assignment for this week was to create a Pascal's triangle

# [Workshop 2](./workshop2)

This workshop we created our own `Stack` class. This class is used in the `Palindrome` class which takes a command line arg and determines if the string passed is a palindrome or not

# [Workshop 3](./workshop3)

This workshop we created a `Shape` interface. We created the classes `Paralellogram`, `Triangle` and `Circle` which implement the `Shape` interface. We also created the class `Rectangle` which is derived from `Parallelogram` as well as `Square` which is derived from `Rectangle`.

# [Workshop 4](./workshop4)

This workshop we created added additional tasks to the program developed in workshop 3. One task was to filter out `Triangle`'s with the smallest perimeter and `Circle`'s with the largest perimeter. The other task was to add the perimeter of all the `Parallelogram`'s and `Triangle`'s that had been filtered in the previous task.

# [Workshop 5](./workshop5)

This workshop we used console IO to create `Student` objects and add it to an ArrayList. These objects were then serialized and written to a file called `students`. The objects were then deserialized and printed out.

# [Workshop 6](./workshop6)

For this workshop we built upon what we created in workshop 5 by adding a graphical interface for serializing and deserializing students using Swing.

# [Workshop 7](./workshop7)

For this workshop we updated workshop 3 by implementing a functional interface called `ShapeArea`. The interface has a function called `calcArea` that is used to calculate the area of the shapes `Circle`, `Rectangle` and `Shape`.

# [Workshop 8](./workshop8)

For this workshop we started using functional programming. A `Student` class was created and all tasks that use functional programming are executed inside the class `StudentProcess`.

# [Workshop 9](./workshop9)

For this workshop we just expanded on the work done in `workshop8`, completing five additional tasks. The tasks are in the `StudentProcess` file and have a description for what they are doing.
